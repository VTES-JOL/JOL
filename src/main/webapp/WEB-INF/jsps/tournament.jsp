            <p><strong>Special Rules:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    If a Methuselah hasn't put anything in global notes about being away, then 24 hours without
                    responding is considered a non-response and the game can continue.
                    They will then have another 24 hours additional time when they need to respond.
                    However, if 72 hours pass after that first time they need to respond, and we haven't heard anything
                    from them, we consider them to have left the game.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Play can continue without having to wait each time for them to respond.<br/>
                    The player can come back to the game, the 24h will still apply, but this time after 48 hours without
                    responding, hen the game will continue like the player left.
                </li>
                <li>
                    For any question or query about applying this, players can call a judge who is not playing at the
                    table to make a decision.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Ensure you are clear on declarations of actions, blocks and/or terms of political actions
                </li>
