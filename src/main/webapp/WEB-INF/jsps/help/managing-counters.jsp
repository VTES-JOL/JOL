    <h4>Managing Blood</h4>
    Currently, there is only one counter type in JOL.  This represents the concept of blood / life / counters.  <br/>
    <ul>
        <li>If the card is a vampire, then the counter colour will be red. </li>
        <li>If the card is imbued, ally, or retainer, then the colour will be green.</li>
        <li>All other cards will show as a generic grey counter. </li>
    </ul>
    The <span class="badge bg-secondary fs-6 px-2 py-1">blood</span> command is used to manipulate counters on the game board.<br/>

    <h4>Transfers</h4>
    The <span class="badge bg-secondary fs-6 px-2 py-1">transfer</span> command is a shortcut for both manipulating pool and blood, to assist during the influence phase.<br/>
    There is no concept of maximum transfers enforced so the player will have to manage the number of transfer available.
    Usage of this command will allow you to transfer pool to blood when using positive values, or transfer blood to pool if negative values are used.
