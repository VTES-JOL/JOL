    <h4>Playing cards & Influencing</h4>
    The <span class="badge bg-secondary fs-6 px-2 py-1">play</span> command is used to play cards from your hand, and the <span class="badge bg-secondary fs-6 px-2 py-1">influence</span> command is used to play vampires from your uncontrolled region.
    Both of these commands add additional context to the game chat, and setup the initial state of the card, like capacity, disciplines, etc.<br/>

    <h4>Drawing cards</h4>
    The best command to use for drawing cards is the <span class="badge bg-secondary fs-6 px-2 py-1">draw</span> command.  While you can achieve the same result with move, draw provides more context in the game chat.

    <h4>Discarding cards</h4>
    There is a specific <span class="badge bg-secondary fs-6 px-2 py-1">discard</span> command to allow you to discard a card from your hand only, with the ability to do this randomly, and the option to replace automatically or not.

    For all other cases, the <span class="badge bg-secondary fs-6 px-2 py-1">move</span> command will allow you to move cards in play from one position ( PLAYER / REGION / CARD ), to another position.
    This command is the most commonly used, and will cover most use-cases inside a game of VTES.
