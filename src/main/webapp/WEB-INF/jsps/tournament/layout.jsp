        <p><strong>Requirements:</strong> You will need a valid VEKN ID linked against your JOL Profile</p>
        <p><strong>Special Rules:</strong>
        <ul>
        <li>Always indicated in Global Notes of your game if IRL events are preventing you for playing.</li>
        <li>players are expected to connect TWICE a day during week days (Mondays to Fridays) to ensure interaction with the tables are not delayed</li>
        <li>players can interact and play during weekend</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Additional Rules - Monday -> Friday</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            if a Methuselah hasn't put anything in global notes about being away, then 24 hours without responding is considered a non-response and the game can continue. They will then have another - 24 hours additional time where they need to respond.
            However, if 72 hours pass after that first time they need to respond and we haven't heard anything from them, we consider them to have left the game. Play can continue without having to wait each time for them to respond.
          </li>
          <li>
            The player can come back to the game, the 24h will still apply, but this time after 48 hours without responding, then the game will continue like the player left.
          </li>
          <li>
            For any question or query about applying this, players can call a judge who is not playing at the table to make a decision.
          </li>
          <li>
            Ensure you are clear on declarations of actions, blocks and/or terms of political actions
          </li>
